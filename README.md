# Extraction of commits


Script for the Laboratory of Programming discipline of the Computational Mathematics course at the Universidade Federal do Cariri.

The script consists of filtering the logins of the authors of each pull request.

The script is commented out, showing that there is no difficulty in using it.

This script is designed to run on the Linux kernel

The script "automatic_extractor.sh" must be used without the folder "spreadsheets", as the script generates it automatically;

The activity of the discipline aimed only to extract information manually from each repository, but a loop was used to facilitate the process
